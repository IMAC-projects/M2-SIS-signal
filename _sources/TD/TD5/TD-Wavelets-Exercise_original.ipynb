Then, you apply again the wavelet transform in the other direction, let's say the columns, for each part of the transformed signal. Thus, you obtain: $high scale(1)(low scale(0))$ and $high scale(1)(high scale(0))$ and  $low scale(1)(high scale(0))$ and $low scale(1)(low scale(0))$. You thus have four parts for the 1 step wavelet transform for a given image.
